                    This project involved developing a system for vehicle speed estimation using 
                    continuous-wave radar technology. Two radar systems, the uRAD and IPM365, 
                    were utilized to capture Doppler shift data for velocity measurement. 
                     By processing the radar signals, accurate speed estimations were achieved 
                   for vehicles moving under various conditions.
                    <br/>
                    <br />
                    The uRAD system demonstrated significantly better performance compared to 
                    the IPM365 in terms of accuracy, reliability, and adaptability to varying
                    environments. The project included signal acquisition, processing, and 
                    analysis to evaluate the capabilities of each radar system. This work showcased
                    expertise in radar signal processing, real-time data analysis, and performance

                    <p><b>Project Description:</b><br>
                        This project focused on designing a predictive call admission control and bandwidth allocation scheme 
                        for integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks(6G) comprising of Low-Earth Orbit Satellite and Terrestrial 5G.
                        The primary goal of the project was to develop admission scheme that reduces frequency of horizontal handoffs
                        in satellite access networks, thus improving overall quality of service.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        A Generalized Linear Model(GLM) was developed to predict call durations at the time of
                        call initiation. Input features included user-specific details such as caller and 
                        callee IDs, call time, the available network resources, and satellite visibility times to admit 
                        users into the most appropriate network segment.
                
                        Key metrics for evaluating the algorithm included call blocking probability and
                        satellite handoff probability. <b>Call Blocking Probability(CBP) </b> is the probability that 
                        a call is blocked due to insufficient resources. On the other hand, <b>Satellite handoff Probability(SHP)</b> is the probability
                        that a call admitted into the satellite access network experience a handoff- resulting from the current
                        satellite moving out of view while the call is still on-going.
                        Synthetic call detail records were generated for training and testing the model, 
                        ensuring realistic traffic patterns based on user behavior and network conditions.

                        This project focused on developing a Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection algorithm 
                        using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) 
                        in heterogeneous wireless networks. The goal was to optimize the selection of RATs—such as
                         5G, WiFi, 4G and WiMAX—based on their performance in terms of bandwidth, latency, 
                         energy efficiency, cost,  and reliability
        
                        The algorithm leverages TOPSIS to evaluate multiple RATs by calculating their
                        proximity to an ideal solution, considering various criteria such as cost, latency, bit error rate, and bandwidth. By integrating these factors,
                        the algorithm ensures efficient and dynamic RAT selection, balancing QoS and 
                        resource utilization.

                    This project focused on developing a system for acoustic source localization
                    using triangulation methods within a distributed sensor network. The system 
                    employed multiple spatially dispersed sensors to capture acoustic signals,
                    and by analyzing the differences in arrival times, the precise location of the 
                    sound source was determined.

                    The project involved designing algorithms for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)
                    estimation and implementing these algorithms to ensure accurate triangulation even 
                    in the presence of environmental noise. Simulations and practical experiments were 
                    conducted to validate the system's performance under varying conditions. This work 
                    demonstrated expertise in sensor network design, acoustic signal processing, and 
                    localization techniques, showcasing the ability to build reliable and efficient 
                    distributed systems for real-world applications.
