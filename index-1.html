                This project focused on designing a predictive call admission control and bandwidth allocation scheme 
                for integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks(6G) comprising of Low-Earth Orbit Satellite and Terrestrial 5G.
                The primary goal of the project was to develop admission scheme that reduces frequency of horizontal handoffs
                in satellite access networks, thus improving overall quality of service.
                <br />
                <br />
                A Generalized Linear Model(GLM) was developed to predict call durations at the time of
                call initiation. Input features included user-specific details such as caller and 
                callee IDs, call time, the available network resources, and satellite visibility times to admit 
                users into the most appropriate network segment.
                
                Key metrics for evaluating the algorithm included call blocking probability and
                satellite handoff probability. <b>Call Blocking Probability(CBP) </b> is the probability that 
                a call is blocked due to insufficient resources. On the other hand, <b>Satellite handoff Probability(SHP)</b> is the probability
                that a call admitted into the satellite access network experience a handoff- resulting from the current
                satellite moving out of view while the call is still on-going.
                Synthetic call detail records were generated for training and testing the model, 
                ensuring realistic traffic patterns based on user behavior and network conditions.

                By processing the radar signals, accurate speed estimations were achieved 
                for vehicles moving under various conditions.
                <br/>
                <br />
                The uRAD system demonstrated significantly better performance compared to 
                the IPM365 in terms of accuracy, reliability, and adaptability to varying
                environments. The project included signal acquisition, processing, and

                This project focused on developing a Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection algorithm 
                using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) 
                in heterogeneous wireless networks. The goal was to optimize the selection of RATs—such as
                 5G, WiFi, 4G and WiMAX—based on their performance in terms of bandwidth, latency, 
                 energy efficiency, cost,  and reliability

                The algorithm leverages TOPSIS to evaluate multiple RATs by calculating their
             proximity to an ideal solution, considering various criteria such as cost, latency, bit error rate, and bandwidth. By integrating these factors,
              the algorithm ensures efficient and dynamic RAT selection, balancing QoS and 
              resource utilization.

                to address the challenges posed by channel distortion in digital communication 
                systems. By employing the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm, the system adaptively
                 minimized errors and compensated for inter-symbol interference (ISI) and channel 
                 noise. The equalizer dynamically adjusted filter coefficients based on received

                Extensive simulations were conducted to test the system under various channel conditions and

                    <br />

                This project focused on developing a system for acoustic source localization
                using triangulation methods within a distributed sensor network. The system 
                employed multiple spatially dispersed sensors to capture acoustic signals,
                and by analyzing the differences in arrival times, the precise location of the 
                sound source was determined.
                  <br />
                  <br />

            The project involved designing algorithms for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)
             estimation and implementing these algorithms to ensure accurate triangulation even 
             in the presence of environmental noise. Simulations and practical experiments were 
             conducted to validate the system's performance under varying conditions. This work 
             demonstrated expertise in sensor network design, acoustic signal processing, and 
             localization techniques, showcasing the ability to build reliable and efficient 
             distributed systems for real-world applications.
