                   I worked with Dr Yunus Abdul Gaffar( UCT, EEE Senoir Lecturer) in development and testing of Vehicle speed measuring radar systems.
                   Specifically, we focused our attention to low-cost IPM365 and high-performing uRAD RADAR Systems. My role was to develop signal processing 
                   algorithms that were used to extract useful speed information from the RADAR signals recieved. Techniques that were used include, Short-Time Fourier Transform(STFT), Spectrogram Analysis, and Dopppler processing.
